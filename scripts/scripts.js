    description: `Aurebesh is by far the most common script used in the Star Wars galaxy. 
      Aurebesh has at least three variants, including those presently known as Droidobesh, Domabesh, and Dishabesh. 
      In fiction, Aurebesh is probably descended from the Old Tongue, an ancestor shared with the High Galactic Alphabet.`
