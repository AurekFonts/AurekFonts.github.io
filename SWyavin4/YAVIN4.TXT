  This is the Yavin 4 font, based on the Alien lettering used in THE ILLUSTRATED
STARWARS UNIVERSE book on the Yavin 4 temple walls.  This was an illustration
of the movie: StarWars: A New Hope. The jungle temple on the Yavin 4 moon was 
the final base from which the rebels attacked the first Death Star.  The script
is also known as Teresian, according to the StarWars comic books.  It seems to 
be written horizontal, but it is uncertain if it is right-to-left or vice-versa.
