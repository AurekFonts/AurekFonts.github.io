Sith Prophecy - Version 2.1
Windows & Macintosh TrueType Font

FONT INFORMATION

This Star Wars font is based on the writing that appears
on Darth Vader's chest box. This font includes all English
letters, numbers, and common punctuation marks (basically,
all the stuff displayed on the keyboard). Uppercase and 
lowercase letters are identical. Also, kerning has been 
enabled for this font.

ACCURACY OF THIS FONT

There are several different versions of text that can be 
seen on Vader's chest box. The most popular version has
been on display at the Magic of Myth Exhibit. This version
is almost identical to the chest box from Return of the 
Jedi. The text is apparently Hebrew, with the middle line
flipped upside-down. The translation for that version is 
supposedly, "His deeds will not be forgiven until he
merits".

The actual chest box from Return of the Jedi is slightly
different, but it's apparent that the Magic of Myth 
version is supposed to recreate the Return of the Jedi
version.

In addition, there is a version from the Empire Strikes 
Back, which has different text. And there are at least 
three other versions which are not accurate to either
film. To have a full set of letters, numbers, and other
characters, I used the text from all six versions for 
this font.

Since the inscriptions are similar to Hebrew, I've 
attempted to map letters according to their Hebrew 
values. See sithprophecy_table.jpg for a full table of
Sith Prophecy letters and their respective keys.
