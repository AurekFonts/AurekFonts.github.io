FONT INFORMATION

This Star Wars font was inspired by writing on two Y-Wing helmets
worn by Grey Squadron in Return of the Jedi. This font includes all
English letters, numbers, and common punctuation marks (basically,
all the stuff displayed on the keyboard). Uppercase and lowercase 
letters are identical except that uppercase letters have a slightly
taller spine. Also, kerning has been enabled for this font.

ACCURACY OF THIS FONT

There are only 11 "canon" letters in this alphabet, taken from two
Y-Wing helmets in ROJ. These 11 canon letters are represented as: 
A, D, E, H, I, L, N, O, R, S, T. These are the 11 most frequently 
used letters in English. I chose them so that written passages 
would look as canon as possible. I modeled the other letters in 
this font to match the "square-ness" of the canon letters, which 
bear a faint resemblance to a sans-serifed Hebrew. 

The concept for numbers comes from one of the markings on the side
of Grey Leader's helmet. Since I had a kind of Hebrew theme going, 
I also used that as an inspiration for the numbers. Modern Hebrew 
commonly uses arabic numerals (1-9), but in ancient Hebrew, letters 
of the alphabet got double-duty as numbers. So, I based numbers 
1-9 (and 0) on the first 10 letters of this font.
