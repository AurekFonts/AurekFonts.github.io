# AurekFonts

Welcome to AurekFonts.github.io, an Star Wars Aurebesh font library (and more!). We are in the never-ending process of collecting old and new in-universe fonts for a galaxy far, far away....

[Later, we'll put a brief explanation and history of Aurebesh right here, but for now, you can read what other people have to say about it [here](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Aurebesh), and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20110429204741/http://www.echostation.com/features/aurebesh.htm).]

But we have lots more than Aurebesh here, because there are thousands of languages in the galaxy! Below, you will find links to our growing collection of fonts, sorted by Script/Alphabet or else by License.

# Contact Us
If you have a font you would like to archive with us, you can message us on [@AurekFonts](https://twitter.com/AurekFonts) on twitter, or email us at [AurekFonts@gmail.com](mailto:AurekFonts@gmail.com).

_Note: We do our best to host any font that has a free license. If a font is not free, we cannot host it here, but we can link to it, (and we will do our best to archive it separately). If you want us to host your original fonts here, you will need to give anyone who downloads it from here a free personal + commercial license. If you like, we can add a donation link of your choosing on each of your fonts' pages._
