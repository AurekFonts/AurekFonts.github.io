Help keep it free and available!"_

# Metal Rebel
✩✩✩✩✩

_Metal Rebel_ is a unique font, based on the 11 characters on Grey Leader's Y-Wing helmet during the Battle of Endor. The original, like the original Aurebesh screen on the Star Destroyer, probably did not represent any actual text. Thus, Erik has assigned them the 11 original characters to the 11 most frequently used letters in English, and then created the rest of the letters to match. Thus, this font is semi-canonical, but then, so was Aurebesh to begin with.

# Mandalorian

_Mandalorian_ is a font based on the screens seen inside the Slave I. This font captures it quite accurately. Hosted here is the 2010 update.

# Aurebesh
✩✩✩

[Free for personal use at dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/aurebesh.font)

This font, by the late Neale Davidson ([Pixel Sagas](http://www.pixelsagas.com/)), is based on the Star Wars RPG that first defined Aurebesh. (It first appeared in _Return of the Jedi_, but the text was a repeating series of characters with some gaps added in.) This is the most standard version of the font and characters. I think it leaves a little to be desired as a general-purpose font, but it also has nostalgia and custom on its side.

----------

# Aurebesh Cantina
✩✩✩✩

[Free for personal use at dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/aurebesh-cantina.font)

This font is a narrower and more characterful Aurebesh, while still retaining the rigidity of the classic Aurebesh.
