Aurebesh Fonts and Other Resources

## Fonts:
- Licensing Available:
  - Sacul (coming soon)
- Free for Personal Use:
  - [Aurebesh](https://www.dafont.com/aurebesh.font) (the standard Aurebesh font) ✩✩✩
    - This font, by the late Neale Davidson ([PixelSagas](pixelsagas.com)), is based on the Star Wars RPG that first defined Aurebesh. (It first appeared in _Return of the Jedi_, but the text was a repeating series of characters with some gaps added in.) This is the most standard version of the font and characters. I think it leaves a little to be desired as a general-purpose font, but it also has nostalgia and custom on its side.
    - A commercial font may be obtained "for a modest fee" by contacting [PixelSagas](http://www.pixelsagas.com/?page_id=3933).
  - [Aurebesh Cantina](https://www.dafont.com/aurebesh-cantina.font) (narrow, "film-noire" Aurebesh font) ✩✩✩✩
    - Another Aurebesh font by Neale Davidson. This one is narrower and more characterful, while still retaining the rigidity of the classic Aurebesh.

# Aurek Besh
✩✩✩

This font is another pretty typical Aurebesh font based pretty closely on the RPG game, but it's free.

# Aurek Besh Hand
✩✩✩✩

Aurek Besh Hand fills an important niche: handwriting. With its block-letter forms, Aurebesh was clearly not intended to be written by hand without extreme modification, but Aurek Besh Hand manages to make it look like someone scrawled it out with a permanent marker. I give it four stars. ✩✩✩✩

These fonts were created for the use of fans and artists. Many of them were created to fill a niche that we felt existed among Aurebesh fonts.
