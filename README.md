# FONTS BY BOBA FONTS (Davide Canavero)
According to his archived site, all of these fonts are free: _["All the fonts presented in this site are freeware: no payment is required for their use. You can distribute them but remember to keep intact the zip archives. Freeware is E-mailware: if you like the fonts send me a message. Let me know also if you use them in your site."](https://web.archive.org/web/20010719193340/http://www.swfans.net/multimedia/bobafonts/about.shtml)_

# Aurek Besh
✩✩✩

This is a pretty straightforward Aurebesh font, based on the Star Wars RPG's alphabet.

[Download (.ZIP)](https://github.com/AurekFonts/AurekFonts.github.io/raw/master/boba-fonts_aurek-besh.zip)

----------

# Aurek Besh Hand
✩✩✩✩

Aurek Besh Hand fills an important niche: handwriting. With its block-letter forms, Aurebesh was clearly not intended to be written by hand without extreme modification, but Aurek Besh Hand manages to make it look like someone scrawled it out with a permanent marker.

# FONTS BY ERIKSTORMTROOPER ([erikstormtrooper.com](erikstormtrooper.com))
In the "LEGAL MUMBOJUMBO" section of the fonts' readmes is the following: _"This font is not officially licensed and is not intended to infringe on any copyright. This font is freeware; it may be distributed freely, but PLEASE distribute all files included in the ZIP archive. This font is NOT to be sold or used for financial gain. Help keep it free and available!"_

----------

# Metal Rebel
✩✩✩✩✩

_Metal Rebel_ is a unique font, based on the 11 characters on Grey Leader's Y-Wing helmet during the Battle of Endor. The original, like the original Aurebesh screen on the Star Destroyer, probably did not represent any actual text. Thus, Erik has assigned them the 11 original characters to the 11 most frequently used letters in English, and then created the rest of the letters to match. Thus, this font is semi-canonical, but then, so was Aurebesh to begin with.

# Mandalorian
✩✩✩✩✩

_Mandalorian_ is a font based on the screens seen inside the Slave I. This font captures it quite accurately. Hosted here is the 2010 update.

These fonts were created for the use of fans and artists. Many of them were created to fill a niche that we felt existed among Aurebesh fonts.

# Free for Personal, Non-Commercial-Use Fonts

# PERSONAL-USE FONTS BY PIXEL SAGAS (Neale Davidson)

A commercial license may be obtained for a modest fee for fonts by Pixel Sagas by contacting [Pixel Sagas](http://www.pixelsagas.com/?page_id=3933).

----------

# Aurebesh
✩✩✩

[Free for personal use at dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/aurebesh.font)

This font, by the late Neale Davidson ([Pixel Sagas](http://www.pixelsagas.com/)), is based on the Star Wars RPG that first defined Aurebesh. (It first appeared in _Return of the Jedi_, but the text was a repeating series of characters with some gaps added in.) This is the most standard version of the font and characters. I think it leaves a little to be desired as a general-purpose font, but it also has nostalgia and custom on its side.

----------

# Aurebesh Cantina
✩✩✩✩

[Free for personal use at dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/aurebesh-cantina.font)

This font is a narrower and more characterful Aurebesh, while still retaining the rigidity of the classic Aurebesh.
