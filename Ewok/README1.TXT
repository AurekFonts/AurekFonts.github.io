 
 Enclosed in this zip file is a font I made from 
 Babylon 5 tv show episodes. I have been taping
 the show for about 2 years now. I have been
 using these tapes to build fonts for the following:
 
  Vorlon:       (All are canon)4-10-98

  Minbari:      (All are canon)4-27-98
 
  Minbari2:     (all canon)4-2-98 

  Shadow:       ( up to the letter O)5-4-97
 
  Narn:         (All are canon) 3-15-98

  Pak'ma'ra:    ( None, all "made up" )5-4-97

  The Great Machine of Epsilon 3:( A thru T are canon)

  Centauri      (All are canon) 7-6-98
Note: There is another Centauri font going around that is mostly invented, Mike has
tried to make his Centauri as canon as possible.  Accept no substitutes!
 
  Wingbats      (dingbats A-T all caps) 2-4-98

  Markab        (A thru V canon) 6-21-97 (W-Z & #1-5 added 7-20-97)

  Brakiri       (A-I canon B5 characters, only "A" certainly Brakiri) 7-20-97
 
  Gaim:         (None, Josh Dixon "invented" all) 10-30-97 

  Drazi:        (A thru I are canon B5 characters) 12-1-97

  Hyach:        (A thru H canon) 5-17-98


  As shown above the font characters that are from the show
 go up to those letters. I have taken liberty with the rest of the 
 font letters & numbers (Pak'ma'ra is my own invention). But
 then people have made up Gorn & Tholian fonts. To date I have 
 not seen any Pak'ma'ra characters on the show.
 At present I'm working on THE GREAT MACHINE OF EPSILON 3 font.
 I will update these fonts from the show or other sources when I find them.

 I especially would like source info, like screen captures of letters
of the Babylon 5 languages I have fonted. 

All font collections come in Windows'® Truetype®

I have also made a StarTrek® "Fabrini", "Preserver", "Melcorian" style font, 7-20-97.
Josh Dixon and Mike also have made Dune®: Guild, Galach[imperial] & Fremen, and also Krell
from the FORBIDDEN PLANET® movie, Ewok from StarWars® & "Drac" from the ENEMY MINE® movie.
