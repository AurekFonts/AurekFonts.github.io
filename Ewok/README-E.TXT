  StarWars® Ewok font By Mike H. Lee.

  Scott Watson sent us a GIF he made of letters he made out from a scroll shown on 
the Ewok Cartoon episode "The Haunted Village", and also from other episodes.  There 
are more characters Scott wasn't able to catch, and the characters do *not* represent
the keys they they are on.  Each character seems to stand for a word or situation.

  Ewok is written downward, not left to right.
