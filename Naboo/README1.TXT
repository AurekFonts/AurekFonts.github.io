 
 Enclosed in this zip file is a font I made from 
 Babylon 5 tv show episodes. I have been taping
 the show for about 3 years now. I have been
 using these tapes to build fonts for the following:
 
  Vorlon:       (All canon)4-10-98

  Minbari:      (All canon)4-27-98
 
  Minbari2:     (All canon)4-2-98 

  Shadow:       ( up to the letter O)5-4-97
 
  Narn:         (All canon) 3-15-98

  Pak'ma'ra:    ( None, all "made up" )5-4-97

  The Great Machine of Epsilon 3:( A thru T are canon)

  Centauri      (All canon) 7-6-98
Note: There is another Centauri font going around that is mostly invented, Mike has
tried to make his Centauri as canon as possible.  Accept no substitutes!
 
  Wingbats      (dingbats A-Z, a-l) 1-30-99

  Markab        (A thru V canon) 6-21-97 (W-Z & #1-5 added 7-20-97)

  Brakiri       (A-I canon B5 characters, only "A" certainly Brakiri) 7-20-97
 
  Gaim:         (None, Josh Dixon "invented" all) 10-30-97 

  Drazi:        (A thru I are canon B5 characters) 12-1-97

  Hyach:        (A thru H canon) 5-17-98

  Abbai:        (All canon, but race uncertain) 9-20-98

  Llort:        (All canon, but race uncertain) 9-20-98

  Anti-Life Runes  (A-H canon, the rest invented) 10-3-98

  B5 Station Human  10-9-98

  Life Machine  (All canon) 1-30-99

  Tak'Cha       (A thru O are canon) 7-7-99

  As shown above the font characters that are from the show
 go up to those letters. I have taken liberty with the rest of the 
 font letters & numbers (Pak'ma'ra is my own invention). But
 then people have made up Gorn & Tholian fonts. To date I have 
 not seen any Pak'ma'ra characters on the show.
  I will update these fonts from the show or other sources when I find them.

If you have any comments, corrections or suggestions for me, you 
can email me at: MikeHlee@aol.com 
 I especially would like source info, like screen captures of letters
of the Babylon 5 languages I have fonted. 

All font collections come in Windows'® Truetype® 
format. These fonts are 'Charity-ware'. (Meaning: if you like 
the fonts and plan to use them, please give a little more than 
usual to your favorite charities such as the Salvation Army 
or others the next time you have a chance.)
