    <h2>Defining a Canonical Reference</h2>

      Aurebesh was first created in 1996 by Stephen Crane for <em>Star Wars Miniatures Battles</em>,
      a game published by West End Games. Crane based his design on an earlier design by Joe Johnston
      seen prominently in the "Shuttle Tydirium code-clearance" scene in <em>Return of the Jedi</em>
      (1985). Crane assigned his modified characters to the 26 letters of the English alphabet, plus
      an additional 8 digraphs (combined letters). He later expanded it to include basic punctuation.

    />
    <p>
      The first several Aurebesh fan fonts predate any official fonts being created, as Crane never
      got the opportunity to create one at West End Games. Among these was Aurek-Besh by Boba Fonts,
      which increased the weight of many of the lines to more closely reflect the characters seen in
      <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, but it contains numerous inconsistencies in terms of line-weight
      and letter height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current primary Aurebesh font being used in canon media is not publicly available, but there
      is sufficient reference material to know that it is consistent and standardized. We will call this
      unknown font the "canonical reference". The canonical reference is closer in weight and curves to
      Aurek-Besh  than Stephen Crane's original design. Whether this means that Aurek-Besh informed the
      design of the canon reference or not, we cannot say without more information, but it is one 
      possibility to consider. Regardless, the canonical reference is not a perfect match to Aurek-Besh,
      as it has been completely redrawn and contains none of the tell-tale discrepencies that appear in
      Aurek-Besh. In fact, the canonical reference does not perfectly match <em>any</em> known Aurebesh
      font.

    <h2>Accuracy</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a visual comparison of every plain Aurebesh fan-font against the canonical reference. The example
      word is "uncopyrightable" as it uses a great variety of letters without repeating.<br>
      Following the comparison, we will make and give our recommendations.

    <h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      After comparing each font against our canonical reference, we make the following recommendations
      for a general-purpose plain Aurebesh font. These are not definitive nor objective recommendations,
      but we have attempted to give each font a fair opportunity, based on its similarity to the shape and
      characteristics of the canon reference and to its completeness, in terms of defined characters, (i.e.
      the more complete a font is, the less likely you are to run into an undefined character while using
      the font).

        readable and relatively intuitive.<br>
        Note: Aurebesh Tycho INV is less accurate, as canon does not use inverted capitals.
