        Guide to the Sacred Jedi Texts
      </h1>
      <h3>A Foreword</h3>
      <p>
        The following are slides for presenting as much information about the Sacred Jedi Texts as possible, from a canon perspective and from an apocryphal perspective.</p>
      <p>
        Images have been prepared from a variety of sources, usually altered in order to more clearly portray the books or their contents.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to use these slides for any kind of public use, including publishing them on social media or a personal site, email me at <a href="mailto:AurekFonts@gmail.com">AurekFonts@gmail.com</a>.

Some of the texts have been identified, while others remain unnamed at time of writing. To keep track of them, we have elected to index each book, based on the order that they appear in Luke's library. The index starts with JT01 (Aionomicum I) on the far left, through JT08 (The Rammahgon) on the far right. (There is an accompanying screenshot from The Last Jedi (2017 film): Rey's hand reaches towards a row of 8 books with strange bindings, which rest on a raised stone shelf. Some of the books have alien writing on their spines, while others are relatively bare, they are all of different dimensions; they look ancient, earthy, and worn. Text is overlayed on the screenshot, labelling the texts from left to right as described in the accompanying text. Four of the books are also labeled with names: JT01 is 'Aionomicum I'; JT05 has the bracketed title '[TLJ Hero]'; JT06 is 'Aionomicum II'; and JT08 is 'The Rammahgon'. To the right, two more titles are acknowledged thus: 'Known Texts without Positive ID: The Chronicles of Brus-bu (JTX1) and Poetics of a Jedi (JTX2)')"

        alt="The Sacred Jedi Texts. JT01: Aionomicum I, page 1. (An image of a large retangular book with a smoothly textured worked leather cover. The pattern on the front forms regular four-leafed floral shapes. The spine is tacked on with brassy metal, and is worn and full of irregular holes.) Known History: The Aionomica was a collection of early writings and correspondences among the first to explore and codify the Force. It is bound in two volumes, compiled by Jedi Master-historian Ri-Lee Howell. The first volume (Aionomicum I) contains annotations attributed to Jedi Master Odan-Urr, (founder of the Great Jedi Library on Ossus). This suggests that Aionomicum I was compiled sometime prior to his death (before 3,996 BBY), while many of its writings are likely far older. At some point, parts of the Aionomica were duplicated and stored in holocrons, but those holocrons are now lost. Both volumes came into Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's possession sometime before 28 ABY. The cover of Aionomicum I or The First Volume is made of organo-silicon hide etched with a decorative pattern. The volume contains marks and notes from Jedi librarians across centuries."

        alt="The Sacred Jedi Texts. JT01: Aionomicum I, page 3. Apocryphal Content (Literal Prop Translations): Protobesh: The majority of the Aionomicum I is written in the Protobesh script, an ancient writing system, which has a one-to-one correspondence with the Latin Alphabet, allowing us to translate the text exactly as it appears in the prop. As such, these translations are not strictly canonical, but may yet provide useful insights. Some passages are left wholly or partially untranslated due to lack of readability. (An acompanying image of a full page spread of Aionomica I is shown. Parts of the page fold out to be wider than the binding of the book. There are geometric diagrams, astronomical charts, and diagrams resembling the hilt of a lightsaber. Notes in several scripts are visible, including the Protobesh mentioned.) (This image is labeled with translations which range in intelligibility from complete thoughts, to seemingly random words, to pure gibberish. Rather than transcribing all of them in this alt text, a subset of the most meaningful notes has been selected, to avoid clutter (spelling has also been standardized)): 'The Force is strongest. / The Force flows freely. / The Force is all.' 'Beware anger and fear the dark side.' 'Split pieces can be no longer used to channel the Force, failed pieces are highly volatile.'"
