The pattern on the front forms regular four-leafed floral shapes. The spine is tacked on with brassy metal, and is worn and full of irregular holes.) Known History: The Aionomica was a collection of early writings and correspondences among the first to explore and codify the Force. It is bound in two volumes, compiled by Jedi Master-historian Ri-Lee Howell. The first volume (Aionomicum I) contains annotations attributed to Jedi Master Odan-Urr, (founder of the Great Jedi Library on Ossus). This suggests that Aionomicum I was compiled sometime prior to his death (before 3,996 BBY), while many of its writings are likely far older. At some point, parts of the Aionomica were duplicated and stored in holocrons, but those holocrons are now lost. Both volumes came into Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's possession sometime before 28 ABY. The cover of Aionomicum I or The First Volume is made of organo-silicon hide etched with a decorative pattern. The volume contains marks and notes from Jedi librarians across centuries."

          JT02 came into Jedi Master Luke Skywalker's possession sometime before 28 ABY, and subsequently passed into Jedi Rey's possession.
          The spine appears to be made of organic material woven or grown for this purpose.
          Known Contents:
          None.
          Possible Identification:
          JT02 could be either The Chronicles of Brus-bu (JTX1) or Poetics of a Jedi (JTX2), but only because neither can be definitively ruled out."

The first panel (counting from the spine) is decorated with the word “JEDI,” written in the relatively modern Aurebesh; the second is decorated with a geometric pattern that does not appear to be linguistic in nature; the third panel contains several symbols of unknown origin or meaning, which we will call Serianan Runes (unofficial name). The pages within are written in an ancient calligraphic script (see JT05: [TLJ Hero], page 3) and feature extensive gold illumination, both in text and in decoration. Most of the pages show signs of extensive damage.
